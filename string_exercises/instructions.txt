Compress

For this exercise, implement a function to perform basic string compression using the counts of 
repeated characters. For example, the string 'aabccccaaa' would become 'a2b2c4a3'. If the 
"compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your function should return
the original string.

Permutation

Given two strings, decide if one is a permutation of the other. For example, 
permutation('dog', 'ogd') would return True whereas permutation('spaceship', 'psmaceshi') would
return False.

Do each exercise in both Python and JavaScript!
