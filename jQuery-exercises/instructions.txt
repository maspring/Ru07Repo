There are two exercises for this afternoon/evening. They will be done in pairs and you should use git to collaborate.

Tic Tac Toe!

The game we all know and love - Tic Tac Toe. We've already done work with an algorithm to see if a winner exists. Now it's
time to make a full blown game! We will rely heavily on jQuery and DOM manipulation to complete this mini project. Really the sky is 
the limit here but we should, at a bare minimum, have a game board, the ability to play again once the game is over, as well as an
overall 'wins count' for each player. Remember to add plenty of styling to your page to make sure that our users know that we didn't
make the page when Space Jam was a thing. How do we do this? Well, jQuery offers plenty of effects (found at http://api.jquery.com/category/effects/
and http://jqueryui.com/). 

Bonus: If you want a challenge, add the ability to play against either a computer or an AI opponent at a specific difficulty (easy or hard). Easy should 
just pick a random place to play, while 'hard' should have the computer pick the best possible move. Essentially, on 'hard' mode, the computer should be unbeatable.

Storefront

After you are satisfied with your tic tac toe game, it's time to set up shop. Let's create an e-commerce site using jQuery for the interactions.
We will need to be able to display all of the current products that our store offers as well as the ability to add a new product (we're putting plenty
of faith in our users here). Each product should have an image, a price, and a button that will add the product to a shopping cart. Our shopping cart
should also be displayed with the product (as well as how many of the product), the price of the product, and a grand total for the user as well as 
and ability to 'check out'.
