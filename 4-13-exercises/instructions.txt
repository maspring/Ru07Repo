Chicken Nuggets (Facebook interview question)

A giant fast food chain sells chicken nuggets in packages of 6, 9, or 20. Therefore, it is possible
to buy exactly 15 nuggets (with one package of 6 and another of 9), but it is not possible to buy
exactly 16 nuggets since no non-negative integer combination of 6, 9, and 20 adds up to 16. To determine
if it is possible to buy exactly n nuggets, you would have to find non-negative integer values such that

6a + 9b + 20c = n

Your goal is to write a function in Python called chicken_nugget_count which takes one argument, n, and
returns True if it is possible to buy a combination of 6, 9, and 20 pack units, otherwise return False.

Bonus!

If you have already finished the Python solution, write the JavaScript version! If you are done with that, 
write a method that takes a data structure representing a deck of cards and returns a shuffled version of
the deck.
