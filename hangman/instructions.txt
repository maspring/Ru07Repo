First things first, we need to go through how to read input from the command line. Before
we jump into Hangman, let's first implement a simple command line temperature converter.
Our goal with the temperature converter is to allow the user to tell us if they're converting
from Fahrenheit to Celcius or vise versa. We then need to convert the temperature, display the
results and allow the user to input another temperature. This might look something like

$ python temperature_convert.py
Please enter a temperature: 70 F
70 F is 2. C
Please enter a temperature: q
Thanks for using the temperature converter!



Onto Hangman! The rules should be well known. The important part
here is to plan out the code rather than just diving in. Think about the routine of the game, what 
order it happens in and how this would happen in the code and how to logically separate the 
components of the game.

Our hangman game will be a command line game that will include a word bank (that you will fill in
with choices) that the computer will randomly choose from. The current state of the game (a picture)
of the hangman) along with the spaces for unguessed letters, the filled in correctly guessed letters,
as well as the letters that have already been guessed should be displayed on each turn.

If the user loses, print out the correct word at the end of the game. It would be nice to also have
a 'give up' option.
