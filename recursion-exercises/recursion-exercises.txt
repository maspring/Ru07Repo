Sorting & Recursion

These three problems are to be done in pairs. They can be implemented iteratively, but the answer will be recursive.
Work through the problem in whatever language you are most comfortable with. Ask questions and make sure that you
both group members fully understand each step of the code (i.e. there SHOULD NOT be one person typing everything while
the other member simply watches).


Exercise #1:
Write a function which implements the Pascal's triangle with the given argument of n (which denotes the output level).
input: integer
output: display in the format below

1
1    1
1    2    1
1    3    3    1
1    4    6    4    1
1    5    10    10    5    1


Exercise #2:
Write a function that takes a binary tree as the argument and returns the maximum height of the given tree. In summary...
input: Binary tree
output: height (integer)
