For the following exorcises you will use the templates available here.
http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#examples

MAKE SURE YOU WRAP ALL OF YOUR JAVASCRIPT IN JQUERY ON DOCUMENT LOADER (READY)

1) Getting comfortable with the grid
Use the following template http://getbootstrap.com/examples/grid/

	a) Create a 4x4 grid with bootstrap where the height of the entire grid == 100% of browser height - hint: you will need to use some custom css for the height

	b) Add in content into the grids:

		1) top left - Implement a javascript clock:
		hint(s): 
			var today=new Date();
			use setTimeout to update the clock

		2) top right - Implement a classroom randomizer
		hint(s):
			Think about the options we can use like:
				Input for people's names
				Mechanism that won't allow selection of the same name twice unless all other names are used

		3) bottom left - Implement a countdown timer/alarm clock
		hints/ideas:
			We need to input the time to countdown to
			Add Audio on alarm
			Add screen effect(s) on alarm
			Add a snooze button

		4) bottom right - Implement a list that can be edited daily
		ideas:
			List can be drag and drop reordered (HTML5?)
			List items can be color coded
			Extra - list items can have a time attached to them that triggers and alarm!
