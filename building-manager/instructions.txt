To practice object oriented python, we are going to create a tool to manage a building. We will need a command line interface
for our tool. On the command line, we should be able to create buildings, units in those buildings, and people to occupy the buildings.

We should also be able (at any time) to view occupants in any floor in any building. Remember to keep your code DRY and to practice 
the OOP methodology (public classes, private classes, static methods, class methods).

This exercise will be done alone but that doesn't mean you should never talk to anybody. This exercise will also be done in Python.
